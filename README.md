# CreditCardIocSample

Problems to solve

1. Write Unit Tests for the methods in VisaCard and MasterCard classes. The Unit Test should not incur the time delay caused by the SendRequest Method.
2. For better performance, use the same instance of CreditCardClient class in both the VisaCard and MasterCard classes.(Inject the same instance of CreditCardClient in both the classes)
